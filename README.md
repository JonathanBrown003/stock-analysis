# Stock Analysis using Visual Basic (VBA)

#### One Detail
The stock analysis refactored VBA code can be found in Module 8 in my VBA_Challenge Visual Basic Editor. 

## Overview of Project: 

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze stock performance of certain ticker symbols during the years 2017 and 2018. Using refactored VBA code allowed the analysis to run more efficiently and much more quickly. Another objective was to determine stock performance for Steve's parents using this streamlined, refactored VBA code. We performed the same functions as the module sections but in a much more efficient manner. 

### What we're trying to Determine
We're looking at the years 2017 and 2018 stock returns for certain ticker symbols. This will help Steve's parents determine which stocks are high performers and which stocks to likely avoid. Past performance doesn't necessarily indicate future results though it is a good indicator. 

### Results
2017 clearly had more favorable returns as compared to 2018. This likely is due to nominal returns of the S&P 500 being negative for the year 2018 (-4.41%) while 2017 nominal returns were positive at 21.94%. A bearish 2018 market was apparent from our analysis of the data:

...while 2017 saw massive gains as evidenced below:

The original VBA script from the module was much less efficient than our refactored code. In fact, the refactored code ran in a fraction of the time.

## Summary:

### Advantages of Refactoring Code
Refactoring code can produce an abundance of advantages such as a more efficient run pattern, reduced run time, and learning for the individual user doing the improvement of the code. For instance, the initial .VBS script was helpful but refactoring the code from the module was challenging with VBA syntax being so new to me as of last week. Having to look for more efficient ways to analyze data will only improve the user's understanding of the syntax and the system. 

### Pro's and Cons to Refactoring the Original VBA Script

Refactoring allows our code to become more efficient and cleaner for the system to process as evidenced by the lower subroutine run times for both 2017 and 2018. Some advantages of better code include user interface and software improvement, automation of repetitive tasks, and faster processing. The code also becomes leaner and more concise in exercising the same processes. 

Cons of refactoring code include the time strain on new viewers of existing code as well as the time consuming nature of the process in general. A new viewer of the code may not know where to start without instruction from the original writer of the code. The chance an error may occur can be quite large as well if the existing coding infrastructure is large.
