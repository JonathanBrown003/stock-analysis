# Stock Analysis using Visual Basic (VBA)

##### One Detail
The stock analysis refactored VBA code can be found in Module 8 in my VBA_Challenge Visual Basic Editor. 

## Overview of Project 
The purpose of this project was to analyze stock performance of certain ticker symbols during the years 2017 and 2018. Using refactored VBA code allowed the analysis to run more efficiently and much more quickly. Another objective was to determine stock performance for Steve's parents using this streamlined, refactored VBA code. We performed the same functions as the module sections but in a much more efficient manner.
